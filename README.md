Hi,

with time I produced a lot of code which is stored in my hard drive. Actually, I adjust codes for every publication so the amount is constantly growing. Since I often look for codes on the internet and combine different approaches I thought that possibly my solutions may help others as well - so here it is. I will try to share my codes related to species distribution modeling here. I started to work on them on my own but nowadays I also often use chatGPT for optimizations. 
They work on my computer so I hope with a little adjustment they will work on yours too. 
If you need something write me a message. 
Also when using it in a publication it would be nice if you could cite the source (not the website but a published work preferentially). 

Good luck,

Kamil
